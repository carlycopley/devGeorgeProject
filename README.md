<h2>This app was created to log the meals the user has eaten. 
There are many benefits to logging your meals especially when you are on a diet or calorie deficit. 
With the help of this app, you can keep track of and improve your eating habits!</h2>

<h2>This is what inspired my login page:</h2>

<h2>This is my HTML code for my login:</h2>
```html
          <li class="nav-item">
            <a class="nav-link active" id="loginLink" href="javascript:void(0);" onclick="toggleLoginForm()">Login</a>
            <div id="loginForm" style="display:none;">
              <label for="username">Username:</label>
              <input type="text" id="username" placeholder="Type here"><br><br>
              <label for="password">Password:</label>
              <input type="password" id="password" placeholder="Type here"><br><br>
              <button type="button" onclick="submitLogin()">Submit</button>
            </div>
          </li>

```


<h2>For the future of this app:</h2>
* I would include a calorie calculator. This will log the amount of calories estimated to be in each meal you submit.
* I would also include a limit you can set for your daily calorie intake. After you submit your meals, you can see what track you are on for your daily calories.
